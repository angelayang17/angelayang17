- 👋 Hi, I’m @angelayang17
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything, really! In particular, I want to expand my skillsets on languages that are helpful for data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python data analysis libraries and Tableau, and am looking to pick up Dart to explore iOS app development in the future.
- 💞️ I’m open to opportunities to collaborate on projects involving data analysis and visualization.
- 📫 Connect with me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelayang17/ or drop me an email at angelayang37@gmail.com !
